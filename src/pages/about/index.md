---
I am a student enrolled in California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo, I plan to graduate in 2021. I have been working with computers all my life and have experience working as a database administrator and website manager. I know the ins and outs of the internet and how it works, and am constantly working to increase my knowledge and skills. I have made countless websites on many different Content Management Systems with all sorts of frameworks and programming knowledge for friends, family, and local businesses.
