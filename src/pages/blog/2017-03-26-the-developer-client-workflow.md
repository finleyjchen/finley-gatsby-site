  Between a web developer and the client, there is a common workflow that proves
  to be effective at communicating both people's opinions.

The work done between each client will vary greatly. Every client has specific needs that need to be catered to.



PLANNING 

Working with clients to identify target audiences, create a website design, and plan implementation of that website design. For small projects, this takes a couple of emails. For larger projects, this will take longer. Art and logos will be collected now for the design.



DEVELOPMENT

Based on the clients needs, I will start creating a mock-up of the website and continue to contact the client for more information. There will be 1-3 revisions.



DEPLOYMENT

Flexible to clientâ€™s desires, I can deploy the website to any web hosting server (including my own Google cloud host) and manage it personally.
